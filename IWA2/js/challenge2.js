/** (c) ACME Inc. 2010 */

/*
 * This is the date that a user created their account 
 */

const date = '10/07/2014';

console.log(date);

//Problem
/*console is used as a function and (date) as argument, 
whereas console is an object in JS and console.log() is the function used to log messages to the console*/

//Solution
//I replaced console(date) with cosnole.log(date) and put a semicolon to end my statement.
