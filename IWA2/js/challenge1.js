/* This is the firstname of the user */

const user = 'John'


/* This is the lastname of the user */
const surname = 'Smith'


console.log(user, surname);

//Problem
//The comment indicating the firstname and the lastname of the user are not closed correctly.
//Semicolons are used in a wrong place, semicolons are used to separate statments not variables within a single statement.

//Solution
//I closed the comments correctly that indicate the firstname and lastname.
//i used semicolons correctly at the endd of the statement and separated variables with a comma.
